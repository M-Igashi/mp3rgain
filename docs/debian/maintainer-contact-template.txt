Subject: mp3rgain - a memory-safe alternative to mp3gain (re: CVE-2023-49356)

Hi Scott,

I'm the developer of mp3rgain, a Rust rewrite of the classic mp3gain tool.
I'm reaching out because I'd like to discuss potential collaboration
regarding the Debian mp3gain package.

## Background

I noticed that mp3gain 1.6.2 still has CVE-2023-49356 (stack buffer overflow
in WriteMP3GainAPETag) listed as unpatched in the Debian Security Tracker.
This motivated me to create mp3rgain as a memory-safe alternative.

## About mp3rgain

mp3rgain is a complete rewrite in Rust that provides:

- Full CLI compatibility with original mp3gain (drop-in replacement)
- Memory safety guarantees (immune to buffer overflow vulnerabilities)
- ReplayGain track and album analysis
- Support for MP3 and AAC/M4A formats
- Active maintenance

Repository: https://github.com/M-Igashi/mp3rgain
crates.io: https://crates.io/crates/mp3rgain
Version: 1.5.0 (MIT license)

Pre-built .deb packages are available from GitHub releases, and cargo-deb
configuration is ready for official Debian packaging.

## Proposal

I'd like to discuss a few options:

1. **Add mp3rgain as a separate package**: mp3rgain could coexist with
   mp3gain, giving users a choice. I could maintain it with the Debian
   Rust Team.

2. **Consider mp3rgain as a potential successor**: If maintaining mp3gain
   becomes burdensome (especially regarding security patches), mp3rgain
   could eventually provide `Provides: mp3gain` as a drop-in replacement.

3. **Collaboration on security**: If you're working on patching
   CVE-2023-49356, I'd be happy to help review or test.

I'm not trying to take over your package - I respect your years of
maintenance work. I just want to offer a potentially useful alternative
and see if there's a way we can work together.

What are your thoughts?

Best regards,
