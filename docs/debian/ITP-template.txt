  Description     : Lossless MP3 volume adjustment - a modern mp3gain replacement

mp3rgain is a modern, memory-safe replacement for the classic mp3gain tool,
written in Rust. It adjusts MP3 volume without re-encoding by modifying the
global_gain field in each frame's side information, preserving audio quality
while achieving permanent volume changes.

Features:
 - Lossless and reversible volume adjustment
 - ReplayGain track and album analysis
 - Full command-line compatibility with original mp3gain
 - Support for MP3, AAC/M4A formats
 - Memory-safe implementation

Relationship to mp3gain:

mp3gain (1.6.2) is currently available in Debian repositories. However,
according to the Debian Security Tracker, it has multiple known security
vulnerabilities including CVE-2023-49356 (stack buffer overflow, unpatched).

mp3rgain is a separate package that provides a memory-safe alternative:
 - Written in Rust with compile-time memory safety guarantees
 - Uses symphonia (pure Rust) for audio decoding instead of C libraries
 - Implements APE tag handling in safe Rust
 - Maintains full CLI compatibility with the original mp3gain

This is intended as a complementary package, not a replacement for mp3gain.
Users who prefer a memory-safe implementation can choose mp3rgain.

Packaging Notes:

This package is published on crates.io (https://crates.io/crates/mp3rgain)
and can be built using debcargo. Pre-built .deb packages are also available
from GitHub releases for testing.

I intend to maintain this package with the Debian Rust Team. If you are
interested in co-maintaining or sponsoring, please contact me.
